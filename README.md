# Silent Errors in Next.js 15 getServerSideProps with Async/Await

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 related to error handling within `getServerSideProps` when using `async/await` for data fetching.  If an error occurs during the asynchronous operation, it may not be properly caught or displayed to the user, leading to unexpected application behavior.

## Problem Description

When fetching data from an external API or database within `getServerSideProps` using `async/await`, exceptions thrown during the asynchronous operation might not be effectively handled or propagated to the client-side. This results in silent failures, making debugging and user experience challenging.

## Solution

The recommended solution involves ensuring that all possible error conditions within `getServerSideProps` are explicitly handled with robust `try...catch` blocks. Additionally, any error information should be appropriately passed to the client-side for proper display and user feedback.  Using a centralized error handling mechanism can further improve error management.
